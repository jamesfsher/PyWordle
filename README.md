# PyWordle

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/7Bt3I1xpNQM

#### Description:
This is my final project for cs50P. It is a copy of NYT's Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) that runs in your terminal, built using Python. The game is played just like Wordle, where you have 5 trys to guess a randomly selected 5 letter word. The game will update you on your progress, listing which letters were correct in the correct placement, and correct in the wront placement. It will also display all available letters to you, removing incorrect letters as you go.
